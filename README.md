# simpleIoCLib
A simple IoC Library and demonstration implemation based on the following brief:

> Write a simple IoC library in either Typescript or Javascript (your choice; we use Typescript). We are not looking for a feature-complete solution - for example, it is okay to support only transient objects and classes (no constants, functions and other types). You will not be evaluated based on the number of features you implement; instead, we are interested to see where you place your priorities when time is limited, and what you do when you know bits are missing, such as support for circular dependencies. We recommend scoping yourself to around two hours, as this best allows you to showcase the choices you make. Your solution should exemplify what you value in a good library that can actively be used by other projects, and further developed by a team (which could include junior developers). Please submit it as a GitHub repository. We are interested to see:

> - The steps you take to make the library great to use
> - How you set up the code for further collaborative development
> - Your approach to testing
> - How you deal with feature gaps and edge cases

#Unit Testing

Setup for unit testing is taken from [here](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-setting-up-unit-tests-with-typescript-871c0f4f1609).

Mocha, Chai and NYC are used for code coverage and unit testing.
